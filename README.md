# Portfolio
As I am nearly finished with the Full Stack Ruby on Rails track program from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), it seems like an ideal time to use the skills I've developed thus far and create my personal website to show what I have been working on since Fall 2018. I am using React to develop this site.

# Why?
I committed to following the curriculum found at The Odin Project through to the end. I've been exposed to a variety of technologies and techniques along the way. I am starting this project from scratch with minimal guidelines and hope the outcome is an adequate portrayal of my skills as developer.

# Concepts/technologies I practiced using:
- CSS-in-JS: Styled Components
- createGlobalStyle 
- responsive-react
- React Transition Group
- Hooks: useState, useEffect
- Deployment with Netlify
